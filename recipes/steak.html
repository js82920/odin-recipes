    <p>A steak is a thick cut of meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, sometimes including a bone. It is normally grilled or fried. Steak can be diced, cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie,
    or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.</p>

    <p>Most steaks are beef, however there can be steaks made from pork, fish, alligator, and other variety of
        animals.</p>
    
    <p>Beef steaks are commonly grilled or fried. Grilled beef steaks can be cooked at different temperatures, or for different lengths of time; the resulting cooked steak ranges from blue (very rare) to overdone. The most common characteristics of a rare steak is a soft, cold, red center. The outside is seared for flavor, while the inside is cooked to suit the diner's preference.
    Steaks cooked well done are usually cooked throughout the entire cut of meat. For example, a beefsteak cooked well done will not have any pinkness in the middle when sliced. Uncooked beef steak can be served raw, such as in steak tartare.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs New York Strip Steaks (2 steaks)</li>
        <li>1/2 Tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Thoroughly pat steak dry with paper towels. Just before cooking, 
            generously season with 1 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>Heat the cast iron pan until hot then add 1/2 Tbsp oil over medium-high heat, swirling to coat. Once the oil is very hot, add steaks to the skillet. Sear the steaks on the first side for 4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then flip and cook another 3-4 minutes. 
            Using tongs, turn the steak on its sides to render the white fat and sear the edges (1-minute per edge).</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and immediately add 2 Tbsp butter, quartered garlic cloves and rosemary to the pan. Spoon the butter sauce over the steak, tilting the pan to get butter on your spoon. 
            Continue spooning the sauce over the steak for a minute or until the steak is about 5-10 degrees from your desired doneness (the temperature will continue to rise another 5-10 degrees while steaks rest).</li>
        <li>Transfer steak to a cutting board, loosely cover and rest 10 minutes before slicing into 1/2" strips to serve. 
            Spoon extra butter sauce over sliced steak to serve.</li>
    </ol>
