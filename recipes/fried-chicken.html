    <p>Fried chicken, also known as Southern fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, 
    deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used.</p>
    
    <p>The first dish known to have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the European Middle Ages. However, the Scottish were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat. There is an English cookbook from 1736 which mentions fried chicken, the “Dictionarium Domesticum”, by Nathan Bailey.
    Meanwhile, many West African peoples had traditions of seasoned fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil).</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>4 Pounds of Chicken</li>
    <li>1 cup of Buttermilk</li>
    <li>2 cups Flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 quarts of Oil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Take cut up chicken and skin them.</li>
    <li>Put flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). 
        Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).</li>
    <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour,
        seal the bag and shake to coat well.</li>
    <li>Place coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray,
        cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper.</li>
    <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. 
        Heat until VERY hot. Then put in as many chicken pieces as you can. Brown the chicken in Hot Oil.</li>
    <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). 
        Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.</li>
    <li>Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. 
        Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.</li>
</ol>
